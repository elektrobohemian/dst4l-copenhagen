    "## Why to Read this Tutorial?\n",
    "* In this tutorial, you will learn about _clustering_ (or cluster analysis). Clustering means to group a set of elements that have similar properties. In other words, clustering forms groups of elements that are more similar to each other than to all elements in the other groups. These groups are typically called _clusters_. This tutorial will introduce and illustrate the very basics of clustering.\n",
    "* The clustering algorithm used is called $k$-means and is used to discover $k$ clusters in your data while you are free to choose $k$.\n",
    "* Furthermore, an algorithm for topic detection within a text corpus will be presented.\n",
    "* You might want to read [NaiveBayes.ipynb](NaiveBayes.ipynb) first as it introduces some vector space model-related concepts that will be used in this tutorial.\n",
    "* At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to cluster arbitrary input data (although the tutorial will use text). Additionally, you will be able to detect topics within a text corpus.\n",

    "As stop word elimination limits the number of index terms, it can increase performance of retrieval but at the same time it may also have specific downsides depending on the retrieval scenario. For instance, imagine a music retrieval system. If you remove the term \"the\" from the index terms, you will no longer be able to search for compound terms such as \"The Cure\" or the like."

    "## What to Do Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "* You might want to apply [_stemming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) in combination with stop world elimnation on your natural language texts. Stemming reduces words to a (sometimes) artifical base form, e.g., the terms \"houses\", \"housing\" and \"house\" will be reduced to \"house\" as they are related to the same semantic concept. This might improve the quality of your topic analysis as these 3 terms will end up in the same topic. Without stemming, the terms can occur in different topic what is not what you would expect from a topic analysis. Adding stemming to the tutorial above is a little difficult as it is not directly supported by the _scikit learn_ package but there is an [article](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html) to get you started using [_NLTK_](http://www.nltk.org/book/), a natural language processing toolkit for Python.\n",
    "* The [data science lab](https://datasciencelab.wordpress.com/) does also provide some nice examples in Python and can inspire you to start your own projects.\n",
    "* The used $k$-means clustering algorithm is neither the most efficient nor the most stable clustering algorithm regarding outliers in your data. An alternative is the [DBSCAN algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) that is also [supported by scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html) and can be used similarly to the clustering above.  \n",
    "* You can try to transfer the things you have learned to other data sets provided by [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#loading-example-dataset).\n",
    "* If you really want to increase you knowledge of typical ML techiques, read about [_support vector machines (SVM)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine). SVMs are widely used in ML for pattern recognition and classification and also supported by [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)."
